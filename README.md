# ✏️ [Hugo Extended](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) via Docker

[![Build](https://github.com/jakejarvis/hugo-docker/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/jakejarvis/hugo-docker/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A base image to ease local development of Hugo sites, including [Hugo Extended](https://gohugo.io/troubleshooting/faq/#i-get-tocss-this-feature-is-not-available-in-your-current-hugo-version) (with SASS/SCSS support) and optional third-party tools ([listed below](#third-party-software)). Now with [multi-architecture images](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/multi-arch/) for native AMD64 and ARM64 support!

## Usage

### Command line

This will start a live server at http://localhost:1313/ from the Hugo site in your current directory:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/src -p 1313:1313 jakejarvis/hugo-extended:latest server --buildDrafts --buildFuture --bind 0.0.0.0
```

### `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  hugo:
    image: jakejarvis/hugo-extended:latest
    ports:
      - 1313:1313
    volumes:
      - ./:/src
    command: server --buildDrafts --buildFuture --bind 0.0.0.0
```

### Notes

When using Docker to run a live server (i.e. `hugo server`), you must pass `--bind 0.0.0.0` as an argument to fix some networking quirks between Hugo, the container, and the host.

## Third-party software

Just in case, the final Alpine Linux container includes a few small third-party tools that are required by certain optional Hugo features:

- [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli)
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Pygments](https://pygments.org/)
- [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/)
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- [Docutils](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/) / [RST](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html)
- [Embedded Dart Sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass-embedded) (amd64 only)

Node (with NPM and Yarn), Go (for [Hugo Modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) support), and Python are also pre-installed.
